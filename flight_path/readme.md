# Flight Path
The path to get from Earth to Mars is varied and non-trivial. While the HTO is the most energy efficient, it may not be the quickest route. If humans are included in MtM, time in flight becomes more sensitive. If MtM is fully non-human, energy efficiency may be optimized.

## Major Components

## Earth to LEO
- Optimal Launch Site
- Calendar Windows
- Target Attitude
- Vehicle Capacities

## Circularizing for parking orbit
- Delta-V to Mass Calculation

## Hohmann Transfer
In orbital mechanics, the Hohmann transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit used to transfer between two circular orbits of different radii around a central body in the same plane. The Hohmann transfer often uses the lowest possible amount of propellant in traveling between these orbits, but bi-elliptic transfers can beat it in some cases.
